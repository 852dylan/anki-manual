# Browser Columns

All browser columns are available for both
[Cards and Notes mode](browsing.md#table-modes) but sometimes with slightly
different names and data. The following table lists the behaviours for both modes.
The list of cards or notes can be sorted by every column except for the
Question and Answer columns.


| Column | Cards mode | Notes mode |
|-|-|-|
| Answer | Shows the back side of the card in one line with the question stripped. You can also choose a [custom format](templates/styling.md#browser-appearance) in the card type editor instead. | Shows the same as in Cards mode, only for the first card of the note. |
| Card(s) | Shows the name of the card's template. | Shows the number of cards the note has. |
